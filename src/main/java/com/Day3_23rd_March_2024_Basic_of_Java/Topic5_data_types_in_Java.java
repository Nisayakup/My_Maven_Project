	//data types: -
	//1. primitive data type
	//2. Non-Primitive data type
	
	//primitive is further divided into 
	
	//1. Boolean 
	//2. Numeric 
	// numeric is further divided character and Integral 
	//  integral is divided into Integer and FloatingPoint
	
	
	//integer will lead to - byte, short, int, long 
	
	// FloatPointing will lead to as - float, double
	
	//character will lead to as - Char
	
	//Boolean will lead to as - Boolean 
	
	
	// primitive data type : 
	
	// total - 8 
	
	//non_primitive data types - too many
